To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an
interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize
CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and
loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be
done with basic knowledge of these technologies..

"I am thrilled to share my recently completed web development project â€“ a basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my ability to create an interactive interface featuring buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator is designed with a clean and user-friendly layout, employing the CSS grid system to ensure precise button alignments.

The HTML structure includes a display screen that dynamically shows user input and calculation results. The functionality of the calculator is powered by JavaScript, where I utilized event listeners to capture button clicks, employed if-else statements to determine the operation selected, and implemented operators and loops to handle user input and perform accurate calculations.

This project challenged me to apply my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a practical context. Through careful design and coding, I aimed to create an intuitive and functional calculator that users can easily interact with. Overall, this project has not only deepened my understanding of these technologies but has also honed my problem-solving skills through the implementation of conditional statements and loops to handle various user inputs. I am excited to continue building on this foundation in future web development endeavors."

"I structured the HTML of the calculator project to provide a solid foundation for user interaction. The layout includes a display screen element, where users can see their input and calculation results in real-time. Additionally, I created buttons for each digit and mathematical operation, ensuring a clear and accessible interface. The HTML serves as the backbone, defining the structure and elements that make up the calculator's user interface." refer the file index.html

"The CSS portion of the project was dedicated to styling and layout, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the calculator. I employed the CSS grid system to meticulously arrange the buttons in a clean and organized manner, ensuring a seamless user experience. The stylesheet defines the color scheme, fonts, and overall aesthetic, creating a visually cohesive design that complements the functionality provided by the HTML and JavaScript." refer the file style.css

"To imbue the calculator with dynamic functionality, I utilized JavaScript to handle user input and perform calculations. Event listeners were implemented to capture button clicks, while if-else statements allowed the program to discern the selected mathematical operation. Operators and loops were employed to execute precise calculations, ensuring accuracy in the results displayed on the screen. JavaScript was crucial in making the calculator interactive and responsive to user actions, providing a seamless and efficient user experience." refer the code script.js
